"What's bogo sort doing"
"Its best"

Bogosort implementation written in C++ using SFML. 

In computer science, bogosort (also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, or slowsort) is a sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm. The function successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. It is not considered useful for sorting, but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with more efficient algorithms.
